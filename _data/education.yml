    The first half of the course was very formal with advanced math courses in measure theory and stochastics. In the second half I focussed on Machine Learning (ML), where I got exposed to a broad range of ML methods.

    In my thesis I applied an attribution method to an image captioning neural network to better understand the network's inner workings. The thesis and all the code can be found (here)[https://github.com/clennan/image-captioning].

    At Warwick I focussed on Econometrics and Behavioural Economics. It was the first time I was exposed to more advanced linear algebra and that I started using R for regression analyses.

    My thesis however was about game theory - I analysed the phenomenon in decision making of attaching greater importance to experienced information than observed information. The thesis won the best dissertation award which I was quite proud of :)
