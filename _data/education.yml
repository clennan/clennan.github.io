    The first half of the course was very formal with advanced math courses in measure theory and stochastics. In the second half I focussed on <mark>machine learning</mark>, where I got exposed to a broad range of machine learning methods.

    In my thesis I applied an attribution method to an image captioning <mark>neural network</mark> to better understand the network's inner workings. The thesis and all the code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/clennan/image-captioning).

    At Warwick I focussed on <mark>Econometrics</mark> and <mark>Behavioural Economics</mark>. It was the first time I was exposed to more advanced linear algebra and that I started using R for regression analyses.

    My thesis however was about game theory - I analysed the phenomenon in decision making of attaching greater importance to experienced information than observed information. The thesis won the best dissertation award which I was quite proud of :)
