    The first half of the course was dominated by advanced math courses in measure theory and stochastics. In the second half I focussed on machine learning, where I got exposed to a broad range of machine learning methods as well as statistical learning theory.

    In my thesis I applied an attribution method to an image captioning neural network to better understand the network's inner workings. The thesis and all the code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/clennan/image-captioning).

    At Warwick I focussed on Econometrics and Behavioural Economics. It was the first time I was exposed to more advanced linear algebra and that I started using R for regression analyses. My thesis was on game theory - I analysed the phenomenon in decision making of attaching greater importance to experienced information than observed information. The thesis won the best dissertation award.
