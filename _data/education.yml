    At Warwick I focussed on Econometrics and Behavioural Economics. It was the first time I was exposed to more advanced linear algebra and that I started using R for regression analyses.

    My thesis however was more game theoretic - I analysed the phenomenon of attaching greater importance to experienced information than observed information in decision making. The thesis won the best dissertation award which I was quite proud of :)
