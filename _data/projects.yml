    We annotated our own hotel dataset and trained CNNs to predict the aesthetic and technical quality of hotel images. The model was put into production and we scored 300+ million images.

    I wrote about this project in more detail on [Medium](https://medium.com/idealo-tech-blog/using-deep-learning-to-automatically-rank-millions-of-hotel-images-c7e2d2e5cae2) and on the [Nvidia Developer Blog](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/deep-learning-hotel-aesthetics-photos/).
