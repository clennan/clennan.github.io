    The goal was to automate the gallery service for hotel offers on [hotel.idealo.de](hotel.idealo.de). We annotated our own hotel dataset and trained CNNs to predict the aesthetic and technical quality of hotel images. The model was put into production and we scored 300+ million images.

    I wrote about this project in more detail on [Medium](https://medium.com/idealo-tech-blog/using-deep-learning-to-automatically-rank-millions-of-hotel-images-c7e2d2e5cae2) and the [NVIDIA Developer Blog](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/deep-learning-hotel-aesthetics-photos/).

    Image-ATM allows anyone to train an image classification CNN with one line of code. The package includes classes for data preparation, training, and evaluation. It also automates training in the cloud on GPU instances.

    We used Terraform in the background to handle cloud setup and destruction. For further details and examples see the project [documentation](https://idealo.github.io/imageatm/).
