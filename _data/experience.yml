    Within six months I have hired four Machine Learning Engineers and established an agile engineering
    team. We have worked on the following projects:
    * Offer category classification model that handles 2000+ categories and produces 40+ million 
      predictions per day. We have extensively optimized inference speed down to 2ms per offer, 
      auto-scaled the deployment on internal Kubernetes cluster, monitoring and alerting through Grafana,
      CI/CD in Jenkins. The new system significantly improved categorisation accuracy.
    * Anomaly detection system to detect shifts in KPIs. The system was adopted by major engineering team 
      and provides real-time alerting system for idealo's direct purchase KPIs.
    * Image classifier deployment toolbox that allows to easily and efficiently deploy CNNs on internal
      Kubernetes cluster. The system consists of a webserver, Redis queue, and modelservers. The webserver 
      uses the FastAPI framework and the modelservers support TensorFlow models. Integrates well with our 
      Image-ATM package.

    The centrally organized Machine Learning team at idealo.de designs and productionizes machine learning 
    solutions for product areas across the company. I have led the following projects
    * Automate the gallery service for hotel offers on [hotel.idealo.de](hotel.idealo.de). We annotated 
      our own hotel dataset and trained CNNs to predict the aesthetic and technical quality of hotel 
      images. The model was put into production and we scored 300+ million images. We open sourced the 
      code and trained models on [Github](https://github.com/idealo/image-quality-assessment).
    * For the product discovery department we trained image classification models to automate the 
      composition of product galleries for new products which reduced their workflow time by 75%. 
      In order to scale model training to hundreds of product categories we designed an image 
      classification software package that allows to train 
      a model with a single line of code. The package includes data preparation, training (including cloud 
      GPU training), and evaluation components such that any software developer at idealo can train and 
      evaluate their own models. We open sourced the package under [Image-ATM](https://github.com/idealo/imageatm).
    * For the customer relationship department we trained tree based models to predict whether a user 
      made a purchase or not (after a leadout). Targeting customers based on these predictions led to 
      a significant increase in revenues.

    Besides the development of machine learning solutions my tasks included
    * Transfer machine learning knowledge to other product areas.
    * Guide and support data science trainees.
    * Present projects at conferences, e.g. PyData Paris, Strata San Francisco, ML Meetup Berlin.

    We built a chatbot that allows to search and buy fashion products in a natural conversation setup, 
    it is available on [Facebook messenger](https://m.me/ChatShopper).
    The bot won a best e-commerce award ([source](https://blog.botmakers.net/1st-chatbottle-awards-winners-are-instalocate-meekan-foxsy-bff-trump-chatshopper-techcrunch-508006f698fc)) 
    and I was responsible for the following projects
    * Migrate NLP system from wit.ai to our own system. The pipeline included a tokenizer, POS-tagger, NER, 
      synonym matcher, and intent classifier, using Spacy and Rasa as a basis for most elements. We 
      experimented extensively with SVM and RNN intent classifiers, as well as RNN and CRF models for NER. 
      I built a testing environment to automate performance tests of newly trained models.
    * To enhance the chatbot experience we built a knowledge graph in neo4j. All graph import and
      update scripts were written in Python. The bot backend was written in JavaScript.
    * To enrich the fashion datasets I trained several image classification models in Python/TensorFlow. 
      The priority was to build small networks with fast processing times. All models were trained and 
      deployed in Google Cloud using the ML- and App-Engine.

    I was the software and machine learning assistant for two reserachers at the institute. Besides 
    writing scripts for automation and descriptive data analyses I mainly trained machine learning 
    models to predict cognitive states from voxel activations. This included
    * Classifying fMRI data with SVMs using scikit-learn, PyMVPA, and libsvm.
    * Extensive experiments with CNNs and convolutional autoencoders for classifications and functional 
      alignment of fMRI datasets using Python/TensorFlow.
